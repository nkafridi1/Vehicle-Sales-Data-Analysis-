## Project Overview
The **Vehicle Sales Data Analysis** project integrates SQL and Python to analyze a large dataset of vehicle sales. The project includes tasks such as:
- Data cleaning and transformation.
- Querying and aggregating sales data.
- Visualizing sales trends.
- Identifying top-performing vehicles and regions.
- Predictive modeling for future sales performance.

## Features
- **SQL Integration**: Use SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from a relational database.
- **Python Analytics**: Perform advanced analysis and generate visualizations using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Data Insights**: Identify key metrics such as total sales, regional performance, and top-selling vehicles.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable to include additional datasets or more complex analyses.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- **Python**:
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
  - Scripting and data visualization.
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL (configurable for other RDBMS).
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SQL Database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vehicle-Sales-Data-Analysis.git
    cd Vehicle-Sales-Data-Analysis
    ```
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure the database connection in the `config.ini` file.

4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Populate your SQL database with vehicle sales data.
2. **Run Queries**: Use pre-defined SQL scripts in the `sql_scripts` folder to query the database.
3. **Analyze Data**: Run Python scripts in the `analysis` folder to perform data analysis and visualization.

### Example
- Query total vehicle sales:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales FROM vehicle_sales;
    ```
- Visualize sales trends in Python:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Load data
    sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

    # Plot trends
    sales_data.groupby('month')['sales'].sum().plot(kind='line')
    plt.title('Monthly Sales Trends')
    plt.show()
    ```
